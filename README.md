# Zoom Clone on the Cloud

A cloud clone of Zoom using ExpressJS, PeerJS, Socket.IO and Heroku

## To try it out :

1 - Open a chrome tab.

2 - Go to https://cloud-zoom-clone.herokuapp.com/

3 - Enter your username.

4 - A room will be created and the URL will be extended. (e.g. https://cloud-zoom-clone.herokuapp.com/xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx)

5 - Send the full (extended) link to up to 3 other people and they'll join automatically. 

## Troubleshoot

Since the application uses a free solution for the peer-to-peer calls, connection might not always work as expected but it will soon enough.

1 - Make sure everyone's using Chrome.

2 - Stay in the room and the others could try refreshing the page.

3 - Stay in the room and the others could try closing and re-opening the page.
